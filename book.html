            attitude bhi nhi dikhaya, bs khalas whi pe impress ho gya tha mai 😀
            Pehle to, I wasn’t sure how we’ll connect, what we would talk about, or what kind of person you’d be. But when I first saw you, Boom!
            dimag se signal hi chla gya. Mai kuch soch hi nhi paya. Ony one thing was in my mind, Kon hai ye apsara, 
            mere liye dharti pe padhari hai! Dekhte hi dil me bj rhi thi gitar. Aur mausam me ho rha tha fulo ka bahar 🌸 
            You kept talking and I kept listening 💫 Sch me, I never expected to meet someone like you, but now, 
            I can’t imagine anyone better than you. ’m glad we met 💕
